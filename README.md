# Gameplay Ability System for Unity
Gameplay Ability System for Unity (or GAS for short) is a Unity framework for creating games which contain any kind of abilities (e.g. DotA, Skyrim).  The framework helps to simplify the interaction between components in a unified manner.  

The approach for this is taken from that used by Unreal's Gameplay Ability System, but implemented in Unity using the Data-Oriented Technology Stack (DOTS) where possible.

## Installation
1. Head over to [Releases](https://github.com/sjai013/UnityGameplayAbilitySystem/releases) and download the latest version.
2. Import package into your Unity project
3. Add the [UniRx](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/integration/unirx-reactive-extensions-for-unity-17276) extension from the Asset Store (or install the [UniRx Async](https://github.com/Cysharp/UniTask) package from GitHub)

## Demo
Clone this repository and open it in Unity.  The Demo project is set up with three abilities, bound to the '1', '2', and '3' keys respectively.  There is a sample "Fire" damaging ability, an ability that does nothing except trigger a global cooldown, and a "Heal" healing ability.

## Code Structure
The code is currently in a state of flux, sharing both Scriptable Object-based implementation and DOTS based implementation.  There is lots of redundant code.  The Scriptable Object-based implementation will eventually be removed.

To understand how everything ties together, go through the *GenericAbilitySystem.cs* class.  Raise an issue if you need help.

More detailed documentation/code layout will be added in a later release.  

## Roadmap
The following functionality will be implemented in GAS:
* ~~ Basic character stats ~~ [Done]
* ~~ Basic gameplay effects ~~ [Done]
* ~~ Basic stat modification from gameplay effects ~~ [Done]
* ~~ Basic abilities ~~ [Done]
* ~~ Cooldown effects ~~ [Done]
* ~~ Cooldown sharing between abilities (e.g. a Global cooldown after every ability cast) ~~ [Done]
* ~~ Visual display of abilities (e.g. an "ability bar") ~~ [Done]
* ~~ Visual display of cooldowns(e.g. on an "ability bar" ~~ [Done]
* Visual display of active gameplay effects
* Sample code showing how to restrict which gameplay effects are displayed (e.g. on a "status bar")
* Periodic effects (such as damage-over-time)
* Targetting system (e.g. single-target, multi-target, intelligent target selection, targettability feedback)
* Customised definition of Ability pre-casting checks
* Gameplay effect interactions (e.g. a "dispel" type effect removing a "poison" effect on the character, or a "dispel" type effect requiring character to be "poisoned" before allowing cast)
* Ability casting times
* Ability Combos (e.g. providing some method of defining ability sequences and then executing abilities based on some condition)
* Nicer/more designer-friendly way of defining abilities and effects
* Nicer/more designer-friendly way of defining character stats
* Networking capability (prediction, replication, synching)
